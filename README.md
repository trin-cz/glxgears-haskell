# GlxGears Haskell

Project to have fun with OpenGL in Haskell. This was my first Haskell program.
Before this I was fiddling with project-euler only. I'm kind of proud that this was
my fist Haskell program AND first OpenGL program at the same time.

A lot can be done better. For example there are almost no top level type signatures.

## Installation

This project needs GLUT dev to be installed on the system.

stack build

## Usage

stack exec glxgears-haskell

hold 'r' to reverse gears rotation

stack exec glxheart-haskell

use 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l' to rotate the heart.

## Contributing

Just fork it and send me a pull request.

## History

Written in 2008. Added stack in 2016. Very little changes needed after 8 years of
Haskell development.
